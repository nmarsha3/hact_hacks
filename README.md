# Gameplan
1. Be able to find the cards in memory (seems easy enough with OllyDbg and the Minesweeper tutorial) NEED TO DO
2. Given a game-state of Freecell, write an algorithm that can win the game and output all moves to the user (We can do that with hard coded cards for now to get progress done on that) NEED TO DO
3. Connect (1) and (2). Be able to get the game-state from the executable to our python program (This is the point I am the least confident on, I am not quite sure how to do this at the moment) NEED TO DO
